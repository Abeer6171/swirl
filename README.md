# Swirl Ice Cream Website üç¶

Hey! This is my Swirl Ice Cream website. It's a simple static site made with HTML and CSS. I made it because ice cream is awesome, and I wanted to create a fun website about it!

## What's in this website?
- **Home Page**: Talks about how great ice cream is and why you should love Swirl.
- **About Page**: Some cool info about Swirl and why it's special.
- **Contact Page**: If you wanna say hi or share your favorite ice cream flavor!

## What's included?
- 3 HTML pages (home, about, contact)
- A favicon (little icon for the tab)
- A CSS file to make it look nice
- An image of ice cream (because, duh!)

## Why I made this?
I love ice cream, and I wanted to make a fun website about it. Plus, I needed to do this for the Swirl program, and I think it's cool to make my own site!

## How to use?
Just open the `index.html` file in a browser, and boom! You‚Äôre on my ice cream site. Hope you like it!

üç® Enjoy and eat more ice cream!
